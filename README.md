# linear-regression-dataset-rmse
Create a  Python script to perform linear regression to establish how temperature affects dissolved  oxygen levels. Test the model on the whole dataset and find the RMSE. 

# Project Title: Temperature-Dissolved Oxygen Relationship Analyzer

# Project Description:

The Temperature-Dissolved Oxygen Relationship Analyzer is a Python script designed to perform linear regression analysis, aiming to establish a quantitative relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in a given dataset. This project enables users to test the linear regression model on the entire dataset and assess its performance through the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Key Features:

1. Linear Regression Modeling: The script utilizes the linear regression algorithm to model the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen levels. This modeling technique helps quantify the impact of temperature on the variability in dissolved oxygen.

2. Whole Dataset Testing: The linear regression model is applied to the entire dataset to comprehensively analyze the global relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen. This allows for a broad understanding of how these variables interact across different instances.

3. RMSE Calculation: The Root Mean Squared Error is computed as a metric to evaluate the accuracy of the linear regression model. This statistical measure quantifies the differences between predicted and actual dissolved oxygen levels, providing insights into the model's predictive performance.

4. Data Visualization: The script may include data visualization components, such as scatter plots with regression lines, to visually represent the relationship between temperature and dissolved oxygen. This aids in better interpretation and understanding of the modeling results.

5. Interpretability: The project focuses on providing clear and interpretable results, making it accessible for users with varying levels of expertise in data science and environmental analysis.

# Dependencies:

The project relies on popular Python libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities, Matplotlib for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations.
